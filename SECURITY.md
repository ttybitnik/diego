# Security policy

## Supported versions

This project is provided "as is" without any warranty or liability, as stated in the license.

While no formal support is guaranteed, best efforts will be made to address reports promptly and responsibly for the latest version.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not open an issue, submit a pull request, or discuss it publicly on the mailing list**, as this can expose the vulnerability to others.

Report the issue via [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) or [eternodevir.com/contact](https://eternodevir.com/contact).

Once the issue is confirmed and a fix is implemented, a security advisory will be issued, and any necessary updates will be published.
